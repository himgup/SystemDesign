* Explain how you would design an event-driven system. What challenges do you foresee in such an architecture?



* You are given a system that stores millions of records. How would you design a service that processes or aggregates these records (e.g., computing totals, analytics) in a performant and scalable way?



* In a microservices environment, how would you implement asynchronous communication between services? What would influence your choice of message broker?



* How would you design a system that delivers real-time updates to clients (e.g., a dashboard or live chat)?



* How would you optimize a REST API for high performance and low latency under heavy load?



* How would you design observability into your application architecture? What tools or patterns would you use?



* Design a critical service that must remain available even when downstream dependencies fail. How would you approach this?

   

* In a distributed environment, how would you manage user sessions securely and efficiently across multiple services?



* Explain how you would design an event-driven system. What challenges do you foresee in such an architecture?



* How would you handle large file uploads (e.g., 5GB video) with backend processing, retries, and validation?



* How would you maintain data consistency in a distributed system where multiple services own different parts of the data?



* How would you scale a read-heavy application with millions of users and a relational database backend?



* What deployment strategies would you use for minimizing risk and downtime during release of critical features?



* How would you ensure secure communication and authorization between internal microservices?



* Design an audit trail system for capturing critical user activity. How would you ensure compliance with data privacy laws like GDPR?
